(** {1 Picos — Interoperable effects based concurrency}

    {2 Introduction}

    Picos, or {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix} pico}-scheduler
    framework, is a framework for building
    {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability} interoperable} elements
    of {{:https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/effects.html} effects based}
    {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking} cooperative}
    {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing} concurrent
    programming models}.  Such models include elements such as

    - {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)} schedulers} that
      multiplex large numbers of {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_thread}
      user level fibers} to run on a small number of system level threads,
    - mechanisms for managing fibers and for
      {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency} structuring
      concurrency},
    - communication and synchronization primitives, such as
      {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)} mutexes and
      condition variables}, message queues,
      {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory} STMs}, and
      more, and
    - integration with low level
      {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O} asynchronous IO}
      systems.

    Picos is not intended to be an application level concurrent programming
    library or framework.  If you are looking for a library or framework for
    programming concurrent applications, then Picos is probably not what you are
    looking for.

    If you are the author of an application level concurrent programming library
    or framework, then Picos should not fundamentally be competing with your
    work.  However, Picos and libraries built on top of Picos probably do have
    overlap with your work and making your work Picos compatible may offer
    benefits:

    - You may find it useful that Picos provides parallelism safe building
      blocks for cancelation, which is a particularly tricky problem to get
      right.
    - You may find it useful that you don't have to reinvent many of the basic
      communication and synchronization abstractions such as mutexes and
      condition variables, promises, concurrent bounded queues, channels, and
      what not.
    - You may benefit from further non-trivial libraries, such as IO libraries,
      that you don't have to reimplement.
    - Potential users of your work may be reassured and benefit from the ability
      to mix-and-match your work with other Picos compatible libraries and
      frameworks.

    Of course, interoperability does have some costs.  It takes time to
    understand Picos and it takes time to implement Picos compatibility.
    Implementing your programming model elements in terms of Picos primitives
    may not give ideal results.  To address concerns such as those, a conscious
    effort has been made to keep Picos as minimal and unopinionated as
    possible.

    {3 Understanding cancelation}

    A central idea of Picos is to provide a collection of building blocks for
    parallelism safe cancelation.  Consider the following characteristic
    example:

    {@ocaml skip[
      Mutex.protect mutex begin fun () ->
        while true do
          Condition.wait condition mutex
        done
      end
    ]}

    Assume that the fiber executing the above computation might be canceled, at
    any point, by another fiber running in parallel.  How could that be done
    both effectively and safely?

    - To be effective, cancelation should take effect as soon as possible.  In
      this case, cancelation should take effect even during the [Mutex.lock]
      inside [Mutex.protect] and the [Condition.wait] operations when the fiber
      might be in a suspended state awaiting for a signal to continue.
    - To be safe, cancelation should not leave the program in an invalid state
      or cause the program to leak memory.  In this case, the ownership of the
      mutex must be transferred to the next fiber or be left unlocked and no
      references to unused objects must be left in the mutex or the condition
      variable.

    Picos allows [Mutex] and [Condition] to be implemented such that cancelation
    may safely take effect at or during calls to [Mutex.lock] and
    [Condition.wait].

    {4 Cancelation in Picos}

    The {!Fiber} concept in Picos corresponds to an independent thread of
    execution.  A fiber may explicitly {{!Fiber.forbid} forbid} or
    {{!Fiber.permit} permit} the scheduler from propagating cancelation to it.
    This is important for the implementation of some key concurrent abstractions
    such as condition variables, where it is necessary to forbid cancelation
    when the associated mutex is reacquired.

    Each fiber has an associated {!Computation}.  A computation is something
    that needs to be completed either by {{!Computation.return} returning} a
    value through it or by {{!Computation.cancel} canceling} it with an
    exception.  To cancel a fiber one cancels the {{!Fiber.computation}
    computation} associated with the fiber.

    Before a computation has been completed, it is also possible to
    {{!Computation.try_attach} attach} a {!Trigger} to the computation and also
    to later {{!Computation.detach} detach} the trigger from the computation.  A
    trigger attached to a computation is {{!Trigger.signal} signaled} as the
    computation is completed.

    The {!Trigger} concept in Picos is what allows a fiber to be suspended and
    later resumed.  A fiber can create a trigger, add it to any shared data
    structure(s), and {{!Trigger.await} await} for the trigger to be signaled.
    The await operation, which is {{!Trigger.Await} implemented by the
    scheduler}, also, in case the fiber permits cancelation, attaches the
    trigger to the computation of the fiber when it suspends the fiber.  This is
    what allows a fiber to be resumed via cancelation of the computation.

    The return value of {{!Trigger.await} await} tells whether the fiber was
    resumed normally or due to being canceled and the caller then needs to
    properly handle either case.  After being canceled, depending on the
    concurrent abstraction being implemented, the caller might need to
    e.g. remove references to the trigger from the shared data structures,
    cancel asynchronous IO operations, or transfer ownership of a mutex to the
    next fiber in the queue of the mutex.

    {3 The architecture of Picos}

    The core concepts of Picos are

    - {!Trigger} — ability to await for a signal,
    - {!Computation} — a cancelable computation, and
    - {!Fiber} — an independent thread of execution,

    that are implemented in terms of the effects

    - {!Trigger.Await} — to suspend and resume a fiber,
    - {!Computation.Cancel_after} — to cancel a computation after given period
      of time,
    - {!Fiber.Current} — to obtain the unique handle of the current fiber,
    - {!Fiber.Yield} — to cooperatively request rescheduling the current fiber,
      and
    - {!Fiber.Spawn} — to start new fibers,

    that can be used to implement many kinds of higher level concurrent
    programming facilities.

    {4 Picos compatible}

    The idea is that in OCaml 5, effects based schedulers provide their own
    handlers for the Picos effects.  By handling the Picos effects a scheduler
    becomes Picos compatible and allows any libraries built on top of Picos to
    be used with the scheduler.

    {4 Implemented in Picos}

    A scheduler is just one element of a concurrent programming model.
    Separately from making a scheduler Picos compatible, one may choose to
    implement other elements of the programming model, e.g. a particular
    approach to structuring concurrency or a particular collection of
    communication and synchronization primitives, in terms of the Picos
    primitives.  Such elements can then be used on any Picos compatible
    scheduler.

    {3 Design goals and principles}

    - {b Simple}: Picos should be kept as simple as possible.
    - {b Minimal}: Picos should be kept minimal.  The dependency footprint
      should be as small as possible.  Convenience features should be built on
      top of the framework.
    - {b Safe}: Picos should be designed with safety in mind.  The
      implementation must be data race free.  The framework should promote and
      always allow proper resource management.
    - {b Unopinionated}: Picos should not make strong design choices that are
      controversial.
    - {b Flexible}: Picos should allow higher level libraries as much freedom as
      possible to make their own design choices.

    The documentation of the concepts includes design rationale for some of the
    specific ideas behind their detailed design.

    {4 Constraints Liberate, Liberties Constrain}

    Picos aims to be unopinionated and flexible enough to allow higher level
    libraries to provide many different kinds of concurrent programming models.
    While it is impossible to give a complete list of what Picos does not
    dictate, it is perhaps illuminating to explicitly mention some of those:

    - Picos does not implement
      {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security}
      capability-based security}.  Higher level libraries with or without
      capabilities may be built on top of Picos.
    - Picos never cancels computations implicitly.  Higher level libraries may
      decide when cancelation should be allowed to take effect.
    - Picos does not dictate which fiber should be scheduled next after a Picos
      effect.  Different schedulers may freely use desired data structures
      (queues, work-stealing deques, stacks, priority queues, ...) and, after
      handling any Picos effect, freely decide which fiber to run next.
    - Picos does not dictate how fibers should be managed.  It is possible to
      implement both unstructured and structured concurrent programming models
      on top of Picos.
    - Picos does not dictate which mechanisms applications should use for
      communication and synchronization.  It is possible to build many different
      kinds of communication and synchronization mechanisms on top of Picos
      including mutexes and condition variables, STMs, asynchronous and
      synchronous message passing, {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model}
      actors}, and more.
    - Picos does not dictate that there should be a connection between the
      scheduler and other elements of the concurrent programming model.  It is
      possible to provide those separately and mix-and-match.
    - Picos does not dictate which library to use for IO.  It is possible to
      build direct-style asynchronous IO libraries on top of Picos that can then
      be used with any Picos compatible schedulers or concurrent programming
      models.

    Let's build an incredible ecosystem of interoperable concurrent programming
    libraries and frameworks! *)

(** {2 Modules reference}

    We first open the {!Picos} module

    {[open Picos]}

    and define a simple scheduler for running the examples in this document on
    OCaml 4

    {@ocaml version<5.0.0[
      let run main =
        Picos_threaded.run ~forbid:false main

    using {{!Picos_threaded} the basic thread based scheduler}
    and on OCaml 5

    {@ocaml version>=5.0.0[

    Picos as samples.

    {3 Auxiliary modules} *)

module Exn_bt = Picos_exn_bt
(** Exceptions with backtraces. *)

(** {3 Core modules}

    Please note that the example code snippets in this documentation may
    e.g. use the [Domain] and [Unix] modules in order to be able to describe
    Picos concepts in isolation in the absence of a Picos compatible
    scheduler. *)

module Trigger : sig
  (** Ability to await for a signal.

      To suspend and later resume the current thread of execution, one can
      {!create} a trigger, arrange {!signal} to be called on it, and {!await}
      for the call.

      Here is a simple example:

      {[
        run begin fun () ->
          let trigger = Trigger.create () in

          let signaler =
            Domain.spawn @@ fun () ->
              Trigger.signal trigger
          in
          let finally () =
            Domain.join signaler
          in
          Fun.protect ~finally @@ fun () ->

          match Trigger.await trigger with
          | None ->
            (* We were resumed normally. *)
            ()
          | Some exn_bt ->
            (* We were canceled. *)
            Exn_bt.raise exn_bt
        end
      ]}

      ⚠️ Typically we need to cleanup after {!await}, but in the above example we
      didn't insert the trigger into any data structure nor did we
      {{!Computation.try_attach} attach} the trigger to any computation.

      All operations on triggers are wait-free, with the obvious exception of
      {!await}.  The {!signal} operation inherits the properties of the action
      attached with {!on_signal} to the trigger. *)

  (** {2 Interface for suspending} *)

  type t
  (** Represents a trigger.  A trigger can be in one of three states: {i
      initial}, {i awaiting}, or {i signaled}.

      ℹ️ Once a trigger becomes signaled it no longer changes state.

      🏎️ A trigger in the initial and signaled states is a tiny object that does
      not hold onto any other objects. *)

  val create : unit -> t
  (** [create ()] allocates a new trigger in the initial state. *)

  val is_signaled : t -> bool
  (** [is_signaled trigger] determines whether the trigger is in the signaled
      state.

      This can be useful, for example, when a [trigger] is being inserted to
      multiple locations and might be signaled concurrently while doing so.  In
      such a case one can periodically check with [is_signaled trigger] whether
      it makes sense to continue.

      ℹ️ {!Computation.try_attach} already checks that the trigger being inserted
      has not been signaled so when attaching a trigger to multiple computations
      there is no need to separately check with [is_signaled]. *)

  val await : t -> Exn_bt.t option
  (** [await trigger] waits for the trigger to be {!signal}ed.

      The return value is [None] in case the trigger has been signaled and the
      {{!Fiber} fiber} was resumed normally.  Otherwise the return value is
      [Some exn_bt], which indicates that the fiber has been canceled and the
      caller should {{!Exn_bt.raise} raise} the exception.  In either case
      the caller is responsible for cleaning up.  Usually this means making sure
      that no references to the trigger remain to avoid space leaks.

      ⚠️ As a rule of thumb, if you inserted the trigger to some data structure
      or {{!Computation.try_attach} attached} it to some computation, then you
      are responsible for removing and {{!Computation.detach} detaching} the
      trigger after [await].

      ℹ️ A trigger in the signaled state only takes a small constant amount of
      memory.  Make sure that it is not possible for a program to accumulate
      unbounded numbers of signaled triggers under any circumstance.

      ⚠️ Only the owner or creator of a trigger may call [await].  It is
      considered an error to make multiple calls to [await].

      ℹ️ The behavior is that, {i unless [await] can return immediately},

      - on OCaml 5, [await] will perform the {!Await} effect, and
      - on OCaml 4, [await] will call the [await] operation of the {{!Handler}
        current handler}.

      @raise Invalid_argument if the trigger was in the awaiting state, which
        means that multiple concurrent calls of [await] are being made. *)

  (** {2 Interface for resuming} *)

  val signal : t -> unit
  (** [signal trigger] puts the [trigger] into the signaled state and calls
      the resume action, if any, attached using {!on_signal}.

      The intention is that calling [signal trigger] guarantees that any fiber
      {{!await} awaiting} the [trigger] will be resumed.  However, when and
      whether a fiber having called {!await} will be resumed normally or as
      canceled is determined by the scheduler that handles the {!Await} effect.

      ℹ️ Note that under normal circumstances, [signal] should never raise an
      exception.  If an exception is raised by [signal], it means that the
      handler of {!Await} has a bug or some catastrophic failure has
      occurred.

      ⚠️ Do not call [signal] from an effect handler in a scheduler. *)

  (** {2 Interface for schedulers} *)

  val is_initial : t -> bool
  (** [is_initial trigger] determines whether the trigger is in the initial
      or in the signaled state.

      ℹ️ Consider using {!is_signaled} instead of [is_initial] as in some
      contexts a trigger might reasonably be either in the initial or the
      awaiting state depending on the order in which things are being done.

  val on_signal : t -> 'x -> 'y -> (t -> 'x -> 'y -> unit) -> bool

  (** [on_signal trigger x y resume] attempts to attach the [resume] action to
      the [trigger] and transition the trigger to the awaiting state.

      already in the signaled state.

      ⚠️ The action that you attach to a trigger must be safe to call from any
      context that might end up signaling the trigger directly or indirectly
      through {{!Computation.canceler} propagation}.  Unless you know, then you

      domain running in parallel with neither effect nor exception handlers and
      that if the attached action doesn't return the system may deadlock or if

      @raise Invalid_argument if the trigger was in the awaiting state. *)

  include Intf.Trigger with type t := t with type exn_bt := Exn_bt.t

  (** {2 Design rationale}

      A key idea behind this design is that the handler for {!Await} does not
      need to run arbitrary user defined code while suspending a fiber: the
      handler calls {!on_signal} by itself.  This should make it easier to get
      both the handler and the user code correct.

      Another key idea is that the {!signal} operation provides no feedback as
      to the outcome regarding cancelation.  Calling {!signal} merely guarantees
      that the caller of {!await} will return.  This means that the point at
      which cancelation must be determined can be as late as possible.  A
      scheduler can check the cancelation status just before calling [continue]
      and it is, of course, possible to check the cancelation status earlier.
      This allows maximal flexibility for the handler of {!Await}.

      The consequence of this is that the only place to handle cancelation is at
      the point of {!await}.  This makes the design simpler and should make it
      easier for the user to get the handling of cancelation right.  A minor
      detail is that {!await} returns an option instead of raising an exception.
      The reason for this is that matching against an option is slightly faster
      than setting up an exception handler.  Returning an option also clearly
      communicates the two different cases to handle.

      On the other hand, the trigger mechanism does not have a way to specify a
      user-defined callback to perform cancelation immediately before the fiber
      is resumed.  Such an immediately called callback could be useful for e.g.
      canceling an underlying IO request.  One justification for not having such
      a callback is that cancelation is allowed to take place from outside of
      the scheduler, i.e. from another system level thread, and, in such a case,
      the callback could not be called immediately.  Instead, the scheduler is
      free to choose how to schedule canceled and continued fibers and, assuming
      that fibers can be trusted, a scheduler may give priority to canceled
      fibers.

      This design also separates the allocation of the atomic state for the
      trigger, or {!create}, from {!await}, and allows the state to be polled
      using {!is_signaled} before calling {!await}.  This is particularly useful
      when the trigger might need to be inserted to multiple places and be
      {!signal}ed in parallel before the call of {!await}.

      No mechanism is provided to communicate any result with the signal.  That
      can be done outside of the mechanism and is often not needed.  This
      simplifies the design.

      Once {!signal} has been called, a trigger no longer refers to any other
      object and takes just two words of memory.  This e.g. allows lazy removal
      of triggers, assuming the number of attached triggers can be bounded,
      because nothing except the trigger itself would be leaked.

      To further understand the problem domain, in this design, in a
      suspend-resume scenario, there are three distinct pieces of state:

      {ol

        {- The state of shared data structure(s) used for communication and / or
        synchronization.}

        {- The state of the trigger.}

        {- The cancelation status of the fiber.}}

      The trigger and cancelation status are both updated independently and
      atomically through code in this framework.  The key requirement left for
      the user is to make sure that the state of the shared data structure is
      updated correctly independently of what {!await} returns.  So, for
      example, a mutex implementation must check, after getting [Some exn_bt],
      what the state of the mutex is and how it should be updated. *)
end

module Computation : sig
  (** A cancelable computation.

      A computation basically holds the status, i.e.

      - running,
      - returned, or
      - canceled,

      of some sort of computation.

      A hopefully enlightening analogy is that a computation is a kind of
      single-shot atomic event.

      Another hopefully helpful analogy is that a computation is basically like
      a cancelable promise and a basic non-cancelable promise can be implemented
      trivially on top of a computation.

      To define a computation, one first {{!create} creates} it and then
      arranges for the computation to be completed by {{!return} returning} a
      value through it or by {{!cancel} canceling} it with an exception at some
      point in the future.  There are no restrictions on what it means for a
      computation to be running.  The cancelation status of a computation can be
      polled or {{!check} checked} explicitly.  Observers can also
      {{!try_attach} attach} {{!Trigger}triggers} to a computation to get a
      signal when the computation is completed or {{!await} await} the
      computation.

      Here is an example:

  (** {2 Design rationale}

      The computation concept can be seen as a kind of single-shot atomic event
      that is a generalization of both a cancelation context or token and of a
      promise.  Unlike a typical promise mechanism, a computation can be
      canceled.  Unlike a typical cancelation mechanism, a computation can and
      should also be completed in case it is not canceled.  This promotes proper
      scoping of computations and resource cleanup at completion, which is how
      the design evolved from a more traditional cancelation context design.

      In this framework, {{!Fiber.computation} every fiber has an associated
      computation}.  Being able to return a value through the computation means
      that no separate promise is necessarily required to hold the result of a
      fiber.  On the other hand, in this framework, {{!Fiber.spawn} multiple
      fibers may share a single computation}.  This allows multiple fibers to be
      canceled efficiently through a single atomic update.  In other words, the
      design allows various higher level patterns to be implemented efficiently.

      Instead of directly implementing a hierarchy of computations, the design
      allows {{!try_attach} attach}ing triggers to computations and
      {{!canceler}a special trigger constructor} is provided for propagating
      cancelation.  This helps to keep the implementation lean, i.e. not
      substantially heavier than a typical promise implementation.

      Finally, just like with {!Trigger.Await}, a key idea is that the handler
      of {!Computation.Cancel_after} does not need to run arbitrary user defined
      code.  The action of any trigger attached to a computation either comes
      from some scheduler calling {!Trigger.on_signal} or from
      {!Computation.canceler}. *)

      {!permit}s the scheduler from propagating cancelation to it.  A fiber also
      has an associated {{!FLS} fiber local storage}.

      ⚠️ Many operations on fibers can only be called safely from the fiber
      itself, because those operations are neither concurrency nor parallelism
      safe.  Such operations can be safely called from a handler in a scheduler
      when it is handling an effect performed by the fiber.  In particular, a

      For example, raising an exception might terminate the whole application

      The idea is that fibers correspond 1-to-1 with independent threads of

      The status of whether propagation of cancelation is forbidden or permitted
      could be stored in the {{!FLS} fiber local storage}.  The justification
      for storing it directly with the fiber is that the implementation of some
      key synchronization and communication mechanisms, such as condition
      variables, requires the capability.

      No integer fiber id is provided by default.  It would seem that for most
      intents and purposes the identity of the fiber is sufficient.  {{!FLS}
      Fiber local storage} can be used to implement a fiber id or e.g. a fiber
      hash.

      The {{!FLS} fiber local storage} is designed for the purpose of extending
      fibers and to be as fast as possible.  It is not intended for application
      programming.

      {!Yield} is provided as a separate effect to specifically communicate the
