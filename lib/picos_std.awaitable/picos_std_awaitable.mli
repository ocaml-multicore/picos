module Awaitable : sig
  (** An awaitable atomic location.

      This module provides a superset of the Stdlib {!Atomic} API with more or
      less identical performance.  The main difference is that a non-padded
      awaitable location takes an extra word of memory.  Additionally a
      {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futex} futex}-like API provides the
      ability to {!await} until an awaitable location is explicitly {!signal}ed
      to potentially have a different value.

      Awaitable locations can be used to implement many kinds of synchronization
      and communication primitives. *)

  (** {1 Atomic API} *)

  type 'a t
  (** Represents an awaitable atomic location. *)

  val make : ?padded:bool -> 'a -> 'a t
  (** [make initial] creates a new awaitable atomic location with the given
      [initial] value. *)

  val make_contended : 'a -> 'a t
  (** [make_contended initial] is equivalent to {{!make} [make ~padded:true initial]}. *)

  val get : 'a t -> 'a
  (** [get awaitable] is essentially equivalent to [Atomic.get awaitable]. *)

  val compare_and_set : 'a t -> 'a -> 'a -> bool
  (** [compare_and_set awaitable before after] is essentially equivalent to
      [Atomic.compare_and_set awaitable before after]. *)

  val exchange : 'a t -> 'a -> 'a
  (** [exchange awaitable after] is essentially equivalent to [Atomic.exchange awaitable after]. *)

  val set : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
  (** [set awaitable value] is equivalent to {{!exchange} [exchange awaitable value |> ignore]}. *)

  val fetch_and_add : int t -> int -> int
  (** [fetch_and_add awaitable delta] is essentially equivalent to
      [Atomic.fetch_and_add awaitable delta]. *)

  val incr : int t -> unit
  (** [incr awaitable] is equivalent to {{!fetch_and_add} [fetch_and_add awaitable (+1) |> ignore]}. *)

  val decr : int t -> unit
  (** [incr awaitable] is equivalent to {{!fetch_and_add} [fetch_and_add awaitable (-1) |> ignore]}. *)

  (** {1 Futex API} *)

  val signal : 'a t -> unit
  (** [signal awaitable] tries to wake up one fiber {!await}in on the awaitable
      location. *)

  val broadcast : 'a t -> unit
  (** [broadcast awaitable] tries to wake up all fibers {!await}ing on the
      awaitable location. *)

  val await : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
  (** [await awaitable before] suspends the current fiber until the awaitable is
      explicitly {!signal}ed and has a value other than [before].

      ⚠️ This operation is subject to
      {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem} ABA} problems.  An [await]
      for value other than [A] may not return after the awaitable is signaled
      while having the value [B], because at a later point the awaitable has
      again the value [A].  Furthermore, by the time an [await] for value other
      than [A] returns, the awaitable might already again have the value [A].

      ⚠️ Atomic operations that change the value of an awaitable do not
      implicitly wake up awaiters. *)

  module Awaiter : sig
    (** Ability to await for a signal from the past.

        {!Awaitable.await} only receives a signal at or after the point of
        calling it.  This API allows the awaiting process to be broken into two
        steps, {!add} and {!await}, such that a signal after {!add} can be
        received by {!await}. *)

    type 'a awaitable := 'a t
    (** An erased type alias for {!Awaitable.t}. *)

    type t
    (** Represents a single use awaiter of a signal to an {!awaitable}. *)

    val add : 'a awaitable -> t
    (** [add awaitable] create a single use awaiter, adds it to the FIFO
        associated with the awaitable, and returns the awaiter. *)

    val await : t -> unit
    (** [await awaiter] awaits for the association awaitable to be signaled. *)

    val remove : t -> unit
    (** [remove awaiter] marks the awaiter as having been signaled and removes it
        from the FIFO associated with the awaitable.

        ⚠️ An explicit call of [remove] is needed when an {!add}ed awaiter is not
        {!await}ed for.  In such a case, from the point of view of lost signals,
        the caller of [remove] should be considered to have received or consumed
        a signal before the call of [remove]. *)
  end
end

(** {1 Examples}

    We first open the library to bring the {!Awaitable} module into scope:

    {[
      # open Picos_std_awaitable
    ]}

    {2 [Mutex]}

    Here is a basic mutex implementation using awaitables:

    {[
      module Mutex = struct
        type t = int Awaitable.t

        let create ?padded () = Awaitable.make ?padded 0

        let rec lock t old =
          if old <> 0 then begin
            Awaitable.await t 2;
            lock t (Awaitable.exchange t 2)
          end

        let lock t =
          if not (Awaitable.compare_and_set t 0 1) then
            lock t (Awaitable.exchange t 2)

        let unlock ?checked:_ t =
          let before = Awaitable.fetch_and_add t (-1) in
          if before = 2 then begin
            Awaitable.set t 0;
            Awaitable.signal t
          end
      end
    ]}

    The above mutex outperforms most other mutexes under both no/low and high
    contention scenarios.  In no/low contention scenarios the use
    [fetch_and_add] provides low overhead.  In high contention scenarios the
    above mutex allows unfairness, which avoids
    {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_convoy} lock convoy}.

    {2 [Condition]}

    Let's also implement a condition variable.  For that we'll also make use
    low level operations in the {!Picos} core library:

    {[
      # open Picos
    ]}

    To implement a condition variable, we'll use the {{!Awaitable.Awaiter}
    [Awaiter]} API:

    {[
      module Condition = struct
        type t = unit Awaitable.t

        let create () = Awaitable.make ()

        let wait t mutex =
          let awaiter = Awaitable.Awaiter.add t in
          Mutex.unlock mutex;
          let lock_forbidden mutex =
            let fiber = Fiber.current () in
            let forbid = Fiber.exchange fiber ~forbid:true in
            Mutex.lock mutex;
            Fiber.set fiber ~forbid
          in
          match Awaitable.Awaiter.await awaiter with
          | () -> lock_forbidden mutex
          | exception exn ->
              let bt = Printexc.get_raw_backtrace () in
              lock_forbidden mutex;
              Printexc.raise_with_backtrace exn bt

        let signal = Awaitable.signal
        let broadcast = Awaitable.broadcast
      end
    ]}

    Notice that the awaitable location used in the above condition variable
    implementation is never mutated.  We just reuse the signaling mechanism of
    awaitables. *)
