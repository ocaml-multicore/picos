    This library essentially provides a conventional set of communication and
    synchronization primitives for concurrent programming with any Picos
    compatible scheduler.

module Mutex : sig
  (** A mutual-exclusion lock or mutex.

      ‚ÑπÔ∏è This intentionally mimics the interface of {!Stdlib.Mutex}.  Unlike with
      the standard library mutex, blocking on this mutex potentially allows an
      effects based scheduler to run other fibers on the thread.

      üèéÔ∏è The optional [checked] argument taken by most of the operations defaults
      to [true].  When explicitly specified as [~checked:false] the mutex
      implementation may avoid having to obtain the {{!Picos.Fiber.current}
      current fiber}, which can be expensive relative to locking or unlocking an
      uncontested mutex.  Note that specifying [~checked:false] on an operation
      may prevent error checking also on a subsequent operation. *)

  type t
  (** Represents a mutual-exclusion lock or mutex. *)

  val create : ?padded:bool -> unit -> t
  (** [create ()] returns a new mutex that is initially unlocked. *)

  val lock : ?checked:bool -> t -> unit
  (** [lock mutex] locks the [mutex].

      ‚ÑπÔ∏è If the fiber has been canceled and propagation of cancelation is
      allowed, this may raise the cancelation exception before locking the
      mutex.  If [~checked:false] was specified, the cancelation exception may
      or may not be raised.

      @raise Sys_error if the mutex is already locked by the fiber.  If
        [~checked:false] was specified for some previous operation on the mutex
        the exception may or may not be raised. *)

  val try_lock : ?checked:bool -> t -> bool
  (** [try_lock mutex] locks the mutex in case the mutex is unlocked.  Returns
      [true] on success and [false] in case the mutex was locked.

      ‚ÑπÔ∏è If the fiber has been canceled and propagation of cancelation is
      allowed, this may raise the cancelation exception before locking the
      mutex.  If [~checked:false] was specified, the cancelation exception may
      or may not be raised. *)

  val unlock : ?checked:bool -> t -> unit
  (** [unlock mutex] unlocks the mutex.

      @raise Sys_error if the mutex was locked by another fiber.  If
        [~checked:false] was specified for some previous operation on the mutex
        the exception may or may not be raised. *)

  val protect : ?checked:bool -> t -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a
  (** [protect mutex thunk] locks the [mutex], runs [thunk ()], and unlocks the
      [mutex] after [thunk ()] returns or raises.

      ‚ÑπÔ∏è If the fiber has been canceled and propagation of cancelation is
      allowed, this may raise the cancelation exception before locking the

module Condition : sig
  (** A condition variable.

      ‚ÑπÔ∏è This intentionally mimics the interface of {!Stdlib.Condition}.  Unlike
      with the standard library condition variable, blocking on this condition
      variable allows an effects based scheduler to run other fibers on the

  type t
  (** Represents a condition variable. *)

  val create : ?padded:bool -> unit -> t
  (** [create ()] return a new condition variable. *)

  val wait : t -> Mutex.t -> unit
  (** [wait condition] unlocks the [mutex], waits for the [condition], and locks
      the [mutex] before returning or raising due to the operation being
      canceled.

      ‚ÑπÔ∏è If the fiber has been canceled and propagation of cancelation is
      allowed, this may raise the cancelation exception. *)

  val signal : t -> unit

  (** {!Counting} and {!Binary} semaphores.

      ‚ÑπÔ∏è This intentionally mimics the interface of {!Stdlib.Semaphore}.  Unlike
      with the standard library semaphores, blocking on these semaphores allows
      an effects based scheduler to run other fibers on the thread. *)

module Lazy : sig
  (** A lazy suspension.

      ‚ÑπÔ∏è This intentionally mimics the interface of {!Stdlib.Lazy}.  Unlike with
      the standard library suspensions an attempt to force a suspension from
      multiple fibers, possibly running on different domains, does not raise the
      {!Undefined} exception. *)

  exception Undefined
  (** Synonym for {!Stdlib.Lazy.Undefined}. *)

  type !'a t
  (** Represents a deferred computation or suspension. *)

  val from_fun : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a t
  (** [from_fun thunk] returns a suspension. *)

  val from_val : 'a -> 'a t
  (** [from_val value] returns an already forced suspension whose result is the
      given [value]. *)

  val is_val : 'a t -> bool
  (** [is_val susp] determines whether the suspension has already been forced
      and didn't raise an exception. *)

  val force : 'a t -> 'a
  (** [force susp] forces the suspension, i.e. computes [thunk ()] using the
      [thunk] passed to {!from_fun}, stores the result of the computation to the

      been forced the computation is skipped and stored result is reproduced.

      ‚ÑπÔ∏è This will check whether the current fiber has been canceled before
      starting the computation of [thunk ()].  This allows the suspension to be
      forced by another fiber.  However, if the fiber is canceled and the
      cancelation exception is raised after the computation has been started,
      the suspension will then store the cancelation exception.

      @raise Undefined in case the suspension is currently being forced by the

module Event : sig
  (** First-class synchronous communication abstraction.

      Events describe a thing that might happen in the future, or a concurrent
      offer or request that might be accepted or succeed, but is cancelable if
      some other event happens first.

      See the {!Picos_select} library for an example.

  (** An alias for the {!Event.t} type to match the
      {{:https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/api/Event.html} [Event]} module
      signature. *)

  val always : 'a -> 'a t
  (** [always value] returns an event that can always be committed to resulting
      in the given [value]. *)

  (** {2 Composing events} *)

  val choose : 'a t list -> 'a t

      to. *)

  val map : ('b -> 'a) -> 'b t -> 'a t
  (** [map fn event] is equivalent to {{!wrap} [wrap event fn]}. *)

  val guard : (unit -> 'a t) -> 'a t
  (** [guard thunk] returns an event that, when {{!sync} synchronized}, calls
      the [thunk], and then behaves like the resulting event.

      ‚ö†Ô∏è Raising an exception from a [guard thunk] will result in raising that
      exception out of the {!sync}.  This may result in dropping the result of
      an event that committed just after the exception was raised.  This means
      that you should treat an unexpected exception raised from {!sync} as a
      fatal error. *)

  (** {2 Consuming events} *)

  val sync : 'a t -> 'a
  (** [sync event] synchronizes on the given event.

      Synchronizing on an event executes in three phases:

      {ol

        {- One of the offers or requests is committed to and all the other
           offers and requests are canceled.}
        {- A final result is computed from the value produced by the event.}}

      ‚ö†Ô∏è [sync event] does not wait for the canceled concurrent requests to
      terminate.  This means that you should arrange for guaranteed cleanup
      through other means such as the use of {{!Picos_structured} structured

      ‚ÑπÔ∏è The {{!Picos.Computation} [Computation]} concept of {!Picos} can be seen

      that exception out of the {!sync}.  This may result in dropping the result
      of an event that committed just after the exception was raised.  This
      means that you should treat an unexpected exception raised from {!sync} as
      a fatal error.  In addition, you should arrange for concurrent services to
      report unexpected errors independently of the computation being passed to
      the service. *)

  val from_request : 'a request -> 'a t

      function. *)

  (** [from_computation source] creates an {{!Event} event} that can be
      committed to once the given [source] computation has completed.

      ‚ÑπÔ∏è Committing to some other event does not cancel the [source]

module Latch : sig
  (** A dynamic single-use countdown latch.

      Latches are typically used for determining when a finite set of parallel
      computations is done.  If the size of the set is known a priori, then the
      latch can be initialized with the size as initial count and then each
      computation just {{!decr} decrements} the latch.

      If the size is unknown, i.e. it is determined dynamically, then a latch is
      initialized with a count of one, the a priori known computations are
      started and then the latch is {{!decr} decremented}.  When a computation

    {2 A simple bounded queue}

    Here is an example of a simple bounded (blocking) queue using a mutex and
    condition variables:

    {[
      module Bounded_q : sig
        type 'a t
        val create : capacity:int -> 'a t
        val push : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
        val pop : 'a t -> 'a
      end = struct
        type 'a t = {
          mutex : Mutex.t;
          queue : 'a Queue.t;
          capacity : int;
          not_empty : Condition.t;
          not_full : Condition.t;
        }

        let create ~capacity =
          if capacity < 0 then
            invalid_arg "negative capacity"
          else {
            mutex = Mutex.create ();
            queue = Queue.create ();
            capacity;
            not_empty = Condition.create ();
            not_full = Condition.create ();
          }

        let is_full_unsafe t =
          t.capacity <= Queue.length t.queue

        let push t x =
          let was_empty =
            Mutex.protect t.mutex @@ fun () ->
            while is_full_unsafe t do
              Condition.wait t.not_full t.mutex
            done;
            Queue.push x t.queue;
            Queue.length t.queue = 1
          in
          if was_empty then
            Condition.broadcast t.not_empty

        let pop t =
          let elem, was_full =
            Mutex.protect t.mutex @@ fun () ->
            while Queue.length t.queue = 0 do
              Condition.wait

            done;
            let was_full = is_full_unsafe t in

          if was_full then
            Condition.broadcast t.not_full;
          elem
      end
    ]}

    The above is definitely not the fastest nor the most scalable bounded queue,
    but we can now demonstrate it with the cooperative {!Picos_fifos} scheduler:

    {[
      # Picos_fifos.run @@ fun () ->

        let bq =
          Bounded_q.create ~capacity:3
        in

          Flock.fork begin fun () ->
            while true do
              Printf.printf "Popped %d\n%!"
                (Bounded_q.pop bq)
            done
          end;

          for i=1 to 5 do
            Printf.printf "Pushing %d\n%!" i;
            Bounded_q.push bq i
          done;

          Printf.printf "All done?\n%!";

          Control.yield ();

          Flock.terminate ()
        end;

        Printf.printf "Pushing %d\n%!" 101;
        Bounded_q.push bq 101;

        Printf.printf "Popped %d\n%!"
          (Bounded_q.pop bq)
      Pushing 1
      Pushing 2
      Pushing 3
      Pushing 4
      Popped 1
      Popped 2
      Popped 3
      Pushing 5
      All done?
      Popped 4
      Popped 5
      Pushing 101
      Popped 101
      - : unit = ()
    ]}

    Notice how the producer was able to push three elements to the queue after
    which the fourth push blocked and the consumer was started.  Also, after
    canceling the consumer, the queue could still be used just fine. *)

(** {1 Conventions}

    The optional [padded] argument taken by several constructor functions, e.g.
    {!Latch.create}, {!Mutex.create}, {!Condition.create},
    {!Semaphore.Counting.make}, and {!Semaphore.Binary.make}, defaults to
    [false].  When explicitly specified as [~padded:true] the object is
    allocated in a way to avoid {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_sharing}
    false sharing}.  For relatively long lived objects this can improve
    performance and make performance more stable at the cost of using more
    memory.  It is not recommended to use [~padded:true] for short lived
    objects. *)
