{0 Asynchronous IO system for Picos}

This package provides an asynchronous IO system for {!Picos}.

{!modules:
  Picos_io
  Picos_io_select
  Picos_io_fd
}

{^ The IO libraries in this package are currently built only on top of the
   standard libraries distributed with OCaml and are hopefully useful for
   building simple applications.}
